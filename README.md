# osu-tracker

Same as https://github.com/respektive/osu-tracker/ read the other readme for more info. This just adds tracking top your top 50s and top 8s taking info from the osu stats api https://osustats.ppy.sh/. Since osustats only updates once a day your lb count value will not always be accurate (the value shown is just osustats count + lb spots from this session) so keep that in mind when you close and reopen the program before osustats updates.
